- Clone and update my customized stater kit based on react-create-app. Remove some packages, add some others and create the folder structure.
- Analyze the design. Understand the components and functionality.
- Download the assets.
- Sketch the structure and possible files for the components of the app, based on the design.
- Create the empty files.
- Start by programming the main views without including the logic (only the "bones" of the interface). Just adding the divs where everything is going to be located
- Analyze the data that will be fetched.
- Create the components that will be used and determine what props will be needed in each of them, while comparing with the fetched data and the design.
- Create reducers and actions.
- Refactor, make the necessary changes.
- Look at any details and search for bugs.
- Clean up the code, make it more readable, remove unnecessary comments.
- Test the app, consider if there's the possibility to improve the functionality and/or interface.
